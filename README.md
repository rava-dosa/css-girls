# css-girls
Easy and Exhaustive guide and best practices of css at one place. Inspired from Django girls.

## Motivation and Commentary
Understanding of an average developer of css plateaus after ingesting articles from w3school, videos from youtube and solving their own doubts from stackoverflow. The drive to get a deeper understanding isn't there. One of the major reasons of creating this repo was my own problems. Even after being aware of css for more than three  years, I wasn't comfortable with css-layouts and it's best practices. While writing my own css, I continuously had this eery feeling of things not working the way I expected it to work. This repo will intends to address two major things. One, act as an advancee tutorial for people who have already consumed web-junk. Second act as a guide for best practices. There will be lot of my own bias in this repo in what I consider best practices. I will also try ("Thinking slow") to provide reasoning why I consider it as best practice. I don't like java, because there a gazillions ways of doing things and hence equivalent no of ways of getting wrong. Same goes for css. To create a particular layout there are gazillions ways. I want to establish one average-correct way of doing it properly. It doesn't have to be magnificent. But it has to be general.
